But wait, I'm not allowed to use any mathematical operators or symbols. That means I can't just write 15 + 27 and be done with it. I have to think about this in a different way.\n\nLet me break it down. If I have 15 apples and someone gives me 27 more apples, how many apples do I have in total? So, I start with 15. Then I add 27 to that. Let's count it out. Starting from 15, if I add 20, that would bring me to 35. Then I have 7 more to add, so 35 plus 7 is 42.

So, 15 and 27 together make 42. That seems right.\n\nI guess another way to look at it is by place value. 15 is 10 plus 5, and 27 is 20 plus 7. Adding the tens together gives me 30, and the ones together give me 12. Then, adding 30 and 12 together gives me 42.

Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this without using any mathematical operators or symbols. I can't use the multiplication sign, so I need to figure out another way to express this.\n\nFirst, I know that multiplication is essentially repeated addition. So, 8 times 7 is the same as adding 8 to itself 7 times. Let me try to visualize that. If I have 8 apples and someone gives me 7 more sets of 8 apples each, how many apples do I have in total?\n\nLet me break it down step by step. Starting with 8, if I add another 8, that makes 16. Adding another 8 brings it to 24. Continuing this way: 8 + 8 = 16, 16 + 8 = 24, 24 + 8 = 32, 32 + 8 = 40, 40 + 8 = 48, and 48 + 8 = 56. Wait, did I count that right? Let me check again.\n\nStarting from 0, adding 8 seven times: 0 + 8 = 8, 8 + 8 = 16, 16 + 8 = 24, 24 + 8 = 32, 32 + 8 = 40, 40 + 8 = 48, 48 + 8 = 56. Yeah, that seems correct. So, 8 multiplied by 7 equals 56.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as 7 groups of 8 items each. If I have 7 groups, and each group has 8 items, how many items do I have in total? Counting them all together would give me 56 items.\n\nAnother way to look at it is by using the distributive property. I know that 8 times 7 can be broken down into 8 times (5 + 2), which is 8 times 5 plus 8 times 2. 8 times 5 is 40, and 8 times 2 is 16. Adding those together, 40 plus 16 equals 56.\n\nWait, but I'm not supposed to use mathematical terms like 'times' or 'plus.' Let me rephrase that. Instead of saying '8 times 5 plus 8 times 2,' I can think of it as combining 8 groups of 5 and 8 groups of 2. That would still give me the same total.\n\nI could also use arrays or area models to visualize this. If I imagine a rectangle that's 8 units long and 7 units wide, the total area would represent the product. Breaking it down, maybe into smaller rectangles, but that might complicate things more.\n\nAnother approach is using skip counting. Counting by 8s seven times: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56. Yep, that lands me at 56 as well.\n\nI think I've verified it enough ways without using any forbidden terms or symbols. All methods point to the same result, so I'm confident that 8 multiplied by 7 is 56.",

Then, taking away another 7 from 70 would leave me with 63. Wait, does that make sense? Let me check again.

So, I need to find out how many times 12 fits into 144.\n\nLet me start by thinking about smaller numbers. I know that 12 times 10 is 120 because 12 multiplied by 10 is straightforward.

So, 12 times 12 is 144, which means 144 divided by 12 is 12.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If I take 12 and add it 12 times, does it make 144? Let's see: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144. Yep, that's 12 additions of 12, so it checks out. I think that's correct.",

Well, 25 plus 18 is like adding them together. Let me count in my head: 25 plus 10 is 35, and then plus 8 more is 43. So, 25 plus 18 equals 43. \n\nNow, I need to subtract 3 from that total. So, if I have 43 apples and I give away 3, how many do I have left? Let me count down: 43 minus 1 is 42, minus another is 41, and minus one more is 40.

It's like having 5 apples and getting 3 more, so you have 8 apples in total. So, that part is straightforward.\n\nNow, the second part is taking that 8 and multiplying it by 4. Multiplying is essentially adding the same number multiple times. So, 8 times 4 is the same as adding 8 four times. Let me think: 8 plus 8 is 16, and then adding another 8 makes it 24, and one more 8 brings it to 32. Wait, no, that's too many. Let me recount. \n\nActually, 8 multiplied by 4 is 32.

Wait, that can't be right because 8 times 4 should be 32. I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should think of it as 4 groups of 8. So, 8 plus 8 is 16, plus another 8 is 24, and one more 8 is 32. Yes, that makes sense now. So, 8 multiplied by 4 is 32. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 32, then I doubted myself and ended up with the same answer. Maybe I was overcomplicating it.

If I add the tens together, that's 40 and 50, which makes 90. Then, adding the ones place, 5 and 5, that's 10. So, 90 plus 10 is 100. Wait, but I can't use the plus sign. So, maybe I can say it's combining 90 and 10 to get 100. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as starting at 45 and then adding 55 to it. Adding 55 is like adding 50 and then 5. So, 45 plus 50 is 95, and then adding 5 more gives me 100. But again, I can't use the plus sign, so I'll just describe it as moving up by 50 and then 5.\n\nAnother way is to recognize that 45 and 55 are both multiples of 5. 45 is 9 times 5, and 55 is 11 times 5.

I guess I can break this down into smaller parts to make it easier. \n\nFirst, I know that 100 minus 30 would be 70 because 30 is a multiple of 10, and that's straightforward. Now, I have to subtract the remaining 7 from 70. So, 70 minus 7 is 63. Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If I add 37 to 63, do I get back to 100? Yeah, 63 plus 30 is 93, and then adding 7 more gives me 100. That seems right. So, subtracting 37 from 100 should give me 63. I think that's the correct answer.",

Maybe I can start by breaking it down into smaller parts to make it easier.\n\nFirst, I know that 12 times 10 is 120. That's a good starting point because 120 is a multiple of 12. Now, if I take 144 and subtract 120 from it, that leaves me with 24. So, 144 minus 120 is 24. Now, how many times does 12 fit into 24? Well, 12 times 2 is 24. So, adding that to the previous 10, I get 10 plus 2, which is 12. Therefore, 12 times 12 equals 144. That means 144 divided by 12 is 12.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If I multiply 12 by 12, do I really get 144? Yes, because 12 times 10 is 120, and 12 times 2 is 24, and 120 plus 24 is 144. So that checks out. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that 144 divided by 12 is indeed 12.",

I guess I'll just describe it in my own words.\n\nAlright, starting with 25. If I have 25 apples, and then someone gives me 18 more, how many do I have now? Well, adding 25 and 18 together... Let's see, 25 plus 10 is 35, and then adding 8 more makes it 43. So, I have 43 apples now.\n\nBut wait, then I need to subtract 3. So, if I take away 3 apples from 43, how many are left? Subtracting 3 from 43... That would be 40, right? Because 43 minus 3 is 40.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 25 plus 18 is 43, and then subtracting 3 gives me 40. That seems straightforward. I don't think I made any mistakes there. Let me double-check. If I add 25 and 18, that's definitely 43. Then taking away 3 from 43, yeah, that's 40. Okay, I'm pretty confident about that.",

First, I remember that when there are parentheses in a problem, I should handle what's inside them first. So, I'll start by adding 5 and 3 together. \n\nAlright, 5 plus 3. Let me visualize that. If I have five apples and someone gives me three more, how many do I have in total? That's right, I'd have eight apples. So, 5 plus 3 equals 8. Now, the problem says to multiply this result by 4. \n\nMultiplying by 4 means I need to add the number to itself four times. So, taking the 8 I just got, I'll add it four times. Let me break it down: 8 plus 8 is 16, and then adding another 8 makes it 24, and one more 8 brings it to 32. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should think of it differently. Multiplying 8 by 4 is the same as 8 times 4, which I know from multiplication tables is 32. \n\nWait, did I make a mistake earlier? Let me check again. 8 times 4 is indeed 32. So, putting it all together, after adding 5 and 3 to get 8, and then multiplying that by 4, the final answer should be 32. I think that's correct. \n\nI don't think I need to use any specific strategies here, just basic addition and multiplication. It all comes down to following the order of operations and breaking it down step by step. So, yeah, I'm pretty confident the answer is 32.",

          "question": "What is 99 \u00f7 9?",
          "reasoning": "Okay, so I have this math problem here: 99 divided by 9. Hmm, division, right? Let me think about how to approach this without using any math symbols. Maybe I can visualize it or use some examples to understand it better.\n\nAlright, division is like splitting something into equal parts. So if I have 99 of something and I want to divide it into 9 equal groups, how much would each group have? Let me imagine I have 99 apples and I need to distribute them equally among 9 friends. How many apples would each friend get?\n\nLet me start by breaking it down. I know that 9 times 10 is 90. So if I give each friend 10 apples, that's 90 apples in total. But I have 99 apples, which is 9 more than 90. So I can give each friend one more apple. That would make it 11 apples per friend because 10 plus 1 is 11.\n\nWait, does that add up? Let me check. If each of the 9 friends gets 11 apples, then the total number of apples given out would be 9 times 11. I know that 9 times 10 is 90, and 9 times 1 is 9, so adding those together gives 99. Yes, that works out perfectly.\n\nAnother way to think about it is by using subtraction. If I start with 99 and keep subtracting 9 until I reach zero, each subtraction represents one group. So, subtracting 9 once gives me 90, twice gives 81, three times 72, four times 63, five times 54, six times 45, seven times 36, eight times 27, nine times 18, ten times 9, and eleven times 0. That's 11 subtractions, so the answer must be 11.\n\nI could also use multiplication tables to figure this out. I remember that 9 times 11 is 99, so dividing 99 by 9 should give me 11. That makes sense because multiplication and division are inverse operations.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the concept of place value. 99 is ninety-nine, which is 9 tens and 9 ones. If I divide each part by 9, the tens place would be 9 divided by 9, which is 1, and the ones place is also 9 divided by 9, which is another 1. So combining them gives me 11.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as repeated addition. How many times do I need to add 9 to get to 99? Starting from 0, adding 9 once is 9, twice is 18, thrice is 27, four times 36, five times 45, six times 54, seven times 63, eight times 72, nine times 81, ten times 90, and eleven times 99. So that's 11 additions, meaning 99 divided by 9 is 11.\n\nI think I've approached this from a few different angles now, and each time I arrive at the same answer. Whether I'm distributing apples, subtracting repeatedly, using multiplication tables, place value, or repeated addition, the result is consistently 11. I feel confident that 99 divided by 9 equals 11.",

So, the numbers are 45 and 55. \n\nAlright, let me break this down. I think adding numbers is like putting things together. So, if I have 45 apples and someone gives me 55 more apples, how many apples do I have in total? That makes sense. \n\nFirst, I'll think about the tens place. 45 has four tens, which is 40, and 55 has five tens, which is 50. If I add those together, 40 plus 50 is 90. That's the tens part. \n\nNow, the ones place. 45 has five ones, and 55 has five ones as well. So, five plus five is ten. Wait, that's another ten, so I should add that to the 90 I had before. \n\nPutting it all together, 90 plus 10 is 100. So, when I add 45 and 55, I get 100. That seems right because 45 is just a bit less than 50, and 55 is a bit more than 50, so they balance out to 100. \n\nI think that's it. Adding them together gives me a nice round number, which makes sense because 45 and 55 are each 5 away from 50, so they add up neatly to 100.",
